Installation
============

This part of the documentation covers the installation of OpenEst.

This library depends on numpy and scipy.  In addition, to use Mean-Size hierarchical sampling, the emcee library must be installed.


``pip install numpy``

``pip install scipy``

``pip install emcee``


Install the package by calling
``python setup.py install``
(or use `develop` rather than install if you'll be editing the code).
